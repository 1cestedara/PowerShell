# Tape Piano VST: A LoFi Piano Plugin for Old School Hip Hop and Ambient Music
 
If you are looking for a plugin that can create dirty, vinyl and sometimes beautiful piano sounds with a cool LoFi vibe, then you might want to check out Tape Piano VST by Thenatan. This plugin is a collection of over 58 piano presets that have been lovingly mangled, re-sampled and processed through various analog outboard effects. You can use Tape Piano VST to create old school hip hop, chill hop, lofi hip hop, movie soundtrack, ambient and electronica music or just add some warmth to any track that sounds too digital.
 
Tape Piano VST features 5 HD layers of strings, pads, choir, organ and atmosphere sounds that you can mix and match with the piano presets. You can also add 4 different textures of hiss, vinyl, 8-bit and hum to enhance the LoFi feel. The plugin also has built-in cassette effects, play and stop buttons, classic sounding reverb, flexible LFO controls and hi & lo pass filters. You can adjust the stereo outputs for each layer and enjoy the ultra low CPU usage and fast patch loading.
