There are several options available for downloading the Embraer 195 Azul for FSX, but one of the most popular ones is the E-Jets v2 series by Wilco/feelThere. This add-on package includes highly detailed models of the Embraer 170, 175, 190 and 195, with realistic flight dynamics, animations, sounds and cockpit systems. It also comes with several liveries, including Azul and Azul Viagens (a subsidiary of Azul that operates charter flights).
 
To download the E-Jets v2 series by Wilco/feelThere, you will need to purchase it from their official website or from a trusted online retailer. The price is $49.95 USD for the download version or $54.95 USD for the boxed version. Once you have downloaded and installed the add-on, you will find the Embraer 195 Azul in your FSX aircraft selection menu.
 
If you prefer a freeware option, you can also download a repaint of the Embraer 195 Azul for the default FSX CRJ-700 model. This repaint was created by Mohammed Al-Khalifa and can be found on Fly Away Simulation website. To install it, you will need to copy and paste the texture folder and the aircraft.cfg entry into your FSX CRJ-700 folder. However, keep in mind that this option will not have the same level of detail and accuracy as the payware one.
 
Once you have chosen your preferred add-on model and repaint, you can start flying the Embraer 195 Azul in FSX. You can choose any airport and weather conditions you like, but if you want to follow a realistic route, you can check out Azul's flight schedule on their website or on FlightAware. Some of the most popular destinations for Azul are SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife and Fortaleza.

- Leather seats with individual inflight entertainment monitors. The monitors have touch screens and offer a variety of movies, TV shows, music, games and flight information. The seats also have power outlets and USB ports for charging devices.
- A spacious cabin with large windows and overhead bins. The cabin has a 2-2 configuration, which means no middle seats and more personal space. The windows are 40% larger than those of other jets in the same category, providing more natural light and better views. The overhead bins are also larger and can accommodate standard carry-on bags.
- A modern cockpit with advanced avionics and fly-by-wire technology. The cockpit has four large LCD screens that display all the flight information and systems. The fly-by-wire technology reduces the pilot's workload and enhances the aircraft's performance and safety.
- A fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engine. The Embraer 195 Azul is powered by two General Electric CF34-10E engines, which have low noise and emissions levels. The engines also have a high bypass ratio, which means they use less fuel and produce more thrust.

The Embraer 195 Azul is not only a passenger aircraft, but also a cargo aircraft. Azul has recently launched the world's first Embraer 195 freighter, which was converted from an E-Jets v1 series model. The freighter can carry up to 18 tons of cargo and has a range of 2,000 nautical miles. Azul plans to convert more E-Jets into freighters in the future, as part of its strategy to expand its cargo business.
