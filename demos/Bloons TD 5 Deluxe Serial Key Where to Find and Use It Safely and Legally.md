# How to Play Bloons TD 5 Deluxe for Free
 
Bloons TD 5 Deluxe is a premium version of the popular tower defense game Bloons TD 5, which was released in 2014 by Ninja Kiwi. It features more content than the flash and mobile versions, such as exclusive tracks, special agents, and the Bloonchipper tower. However, the game is no longer available for purchase, and it requires an activation key to play.
 
Many fans of the Bloons series are curious about Bloons TD 5 Deluxe, but they don't know how to get their hands on a copy of the game. Some may resort to searching for a serial key online, but this is not a safe or legal option. Serial keys are often fake, expired, or infected with malware. Moreover, using a serial key without purchasing the game is considered piracy, which can have serious consequences.
