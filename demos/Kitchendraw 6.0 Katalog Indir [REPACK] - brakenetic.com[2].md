RailClone Pro is unlike any other tool on the market. It has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to create complex objects with just a few clicks. You can choose from hundreds of built-in presets, adapt existing objects by adding your own geometry, or even create your own from scratch using RailClone Pro's easy-to-understand visual editor. You can also use operators to manipulate geometry, create patterns, randomise transforms, UVs and materials IDs, create conditional relationships and much more.
 
RailClone Pro is also very fast and efficient. It uses native instancing in V-Ray, Corona, Arnold, Mental Ray, and Redshift to render millions of polygons with minimal memory usage. It also has automatic UVW mapping and hole capping features to save you time and hassle. You can also use RailClone Colour map to create realistic variations in your objects. And if you need to convert your objects to editable meshes or instances, you can do that with RailClone Tools.
 
RailClone Pro is the ultimate parametric modelling plugin for 3ds Max that will take your 3D projects to the next level. Whether you are an architect, a designer, a visualiser, a game developer, or a hobbyist, RailClone Pro will help you create amazing 3D environments with ease and efficiency. Don't miss this opportunity to get RailClone Pro today and unleash your creativity!

The first thing you need to do is to install RailClone Pro on your computer. You can download it from the iToo Software website and follow the instructions to activate your license. Once you have RailClone Pro installed, you can launch 3ds Max and start creating.
 
The second thing you need to do is to prepare your source geometry. RailClone Pro works by assembling and repeating existing pieces of geometry along splines or surfaces. You can use any geometry that you have created or imported in 3ds Max, as long as it is modular and has its pivot point set correctly. The pivot point determines how the geometry is aligned to the path. For example, if you want to create a fence, you need to have a post, a rail, and a panel as separate objects, and make sure their pivot points are at the bottom center of each object.
 
The third thing you need to do is to create a spline or a surface that defines the path or the area where you want to distribute your geometry. You can use any spline or surface that you have created or imported in 3ds Max, as long as it is continuous and closed. The spline or surface determines the shape and size of your parametric object.
 
The fourth thing you need to do is to create a RailClone object and open the Style Editor. The Style Editor is where you define the rules and logic for your parametric object using nodes. Nodes are graphical representations of functions that can be connected together to create a style. There are three types of nodes: base objects, generators, and operators.
 
Base objects are nodes that reference your source geometry and splines or surfaces. You need to drag and drop your geometry and spline or surface from the scene into the Style Editor as base objects.
 
Generators are nodes that create arrays of geometry along splines or surfaces using base objects as inputs. There are two types of generators: L1S and A2S. L1S generator creates one-dimensional arrays along splines, while A2S generator creates two-dimensional arrays on surfaces. You need to drag and drop a generator node from the node list into the Style Editor and connect your base objects to it.
 
Operators are nodes that manipulate geometry in various ways, such as transforming, randomising, sequencing, mirroring, grouping, selecting, composing, etc. You can use operators to add variation and complexity to your parametric object. You need to drag and drop operator nodes from the node list into the Style Editor and connect them between base objects and generators.
 
The fifth thing you need to do is to adjust the parameters of your nodes to fine-tune your parametric object. Each node has its own parameters that control its behavior and appearance. You can access them by selecting a node and opening the Properties panel. For example, you can change the spacing, padding, alignment, scaling, rotation, offset, clipping, slicing, etc. of your geometry using the parameters of your nodes.
 
The sixth thing you need to do is to test and preview your parametric object in the viewport. You can use different display modes to see how your object looks like in different levels of detail. You can also use RailClone Tools to convert your object to editable meshes or instances if you need to.
 
That's it! You have just created your first parametric object with RailClone Pro. Congratulations! You can now save your style as a preset in the library browser and reuse it for other projects. You can also edit and modify your style anytime by opening the Style Editor again.
