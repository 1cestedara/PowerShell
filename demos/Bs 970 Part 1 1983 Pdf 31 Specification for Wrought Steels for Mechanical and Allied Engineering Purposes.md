Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 is divided into six sections:
 
- Section A: General information and definitions
- Section B: Carbon and carbon-manganese steels
- Section C: Alloy steels
- Section D: Stainless steels
- Section E: Free-cutting steels
- Section F: Miscellaneous steels

Each section contains a table that lists the steel grades by their designation, number, and name. The table also provides information on the chemical composition limits, mechanical properties, heat treatment, and condition of delivery for each grade. For example, the table for Section B shows that the steel grade 070M20 has a designation of B.S.970-1:1983-070M20, a number of EN3A, and a name of Carbon Steel. The table also shows that this grade has a carbon content of 0.16-0.24%, a tensile strength of 430 N/mm min., a hardness of not more than 255 HB, and a condition of delivery of as rolled or as forged.
 
Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 also provides guidance on the selection of steel grades based on their typical uses, such as shafts, bolts, studs, couplings, machinery components, etc. For example, the document suggests that the steel grade 080M40 is suitable for dynamo and motor shafts, heat treated bolts and studs, crankshafts, connecting rods, driving rings, flanges, railway couplings, axles, brackets, housings, and parts subjected to high stresses or wear.

Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 is available online as a PDF file from various sources. However, users should be aware that Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 may not reflect the current standards or practices in the steel industry. Users should consult the latest edition of Bs EN ISO 683-1:2018 for updated information on steel grades and specifications.
  
Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 also explains the designation system for steel grades. The designation consists of three parts: a letter, a number, and a name. The letter indicates the section of the document that the grade belongs to. For example, A for general information and definitions, B for carbon and carbon-manganese steels, C for alloy steels, etc. The number indicates the order of listing within each section. For example, 070M20 is the first grade in Section B, 080M40 is the second grade in Section B, etc. The name indicates the main characteristic or application of the grade. For example, Carbon Steel for 070M20, Carbon Manganese Steel for 080M40, etc.
 
Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 also provides some examples of steel grades that have been replaced by newer standards or have been withdrawn from use. For example, EN8 has been replaced by 080M40, EN19 has been replaced by 709M40, EN24 has been replaced by 817M40, etc. Users should check the current status of any steel grade before using it.
 
Bs 970 Part 1 1983 Pdf 31 is a valuable resource for anyone who needs to know more about British steel specifications. However, it is not a substitute for professional advice or testing. Users should always consult with qualified experts and follow the relevant codes and regulations when selecting and using steel grades.
