If you are looking for high-quality audio plugins that can enhance your music production, you should check out Leapwing Audio â Bundle 2019. This bundle includes four amazing plugins that can help you shape your sound, add depth and width, control dynamics, and create realistic reverb effects. In this article, we will review each plugin and show you how they can improve your mixes and masters.
 
## Leapwing Audio â DynOne 3
 
DynOne 3 is a multiband compressor that allows you to adjust the dynamics of your audio with ease and precision. Unlike traditional compressors that use threshold and ratio settings, DynOne 3 uses level-independent processing that adapts to the input signal. This means you can achieve consistent and transparent compression without worrying about over-compression or pumping artifacts.

DynOne 3 features five bands that can be soloed or bypassed individually, a linear phase crossover filter that preserves the phase coherence of your audio, a sidechain filter that lets you focus on specific frequency ranges, a parallel mode that blends the compressed and uncompressed signals, and a loudness meter that shows you the perceived loudness of your output. You can also use the presets or the smart mode to get started quickly.
 
## Leapwing Audio â CenterOne 3
 
CenterOne 3 is a plugin that allows you to manipulate the center and side channels of your stereo audio. You can use it to adjust the balance between the center and side signals, widen or narrow the stereo image, extract or remove the center channel, or create a phantom center from a mono signal.
 
CenterOne 3 features a center channel fader that lets you boost or attenuate the center signal, a center channel extractor that lets you isolate or remove the center signal from the stereo mix, a center channel width control that lets you change the width of the center signal without affecting the side signal, a side channel width control that lets you change the width of the side signal without affecting the center signal, and a mono bass control that lets you make the low frequencies mono for better compatibility with mono playback systems.
 
## Leapwing Audio â StageOne 1.4
 
StageOne 1.4 is a plugin that allows you to enhance the depth and width of your stereo audio. You can use it to add natural-sounding depth to your mixes, widen your stereo image without compromising mono compatibility, or create artificial stereo from mono sources.
 
StageOne 1.4 features a depth control that lets you add depth to your audio by using psychoacoustic processing that simulates the distance between the listener and the sound source, a width control that lets you widen your stereo image by using phase manipulation and mid-side processing that preserves the mono compatibility of your audio, and a mono spread control that lets you create artificial stereo from mono sources by using frequency-dependent panning and delay.
