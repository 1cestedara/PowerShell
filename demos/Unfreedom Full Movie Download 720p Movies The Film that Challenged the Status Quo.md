The movie follows two parallel stories: one of a Muslim terrorist who kidnaps a liberal Muslim scholar in New York, and another of a lesbian woman who escapes an arranged marriage in Delhi. The movie was banned in India for its explicit scenes of violence and sexuality, and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences.

Unfreedom is a bold and provocative movie that challenges the viewers to question their own beliefs and prejudices. It is not a movie for the faint-hearted, but for those who are willing to confront the harsh realities of the world we live in.
  
The movie features a talented cast of actors, such as Victor Banerjee, Adil Hussain, Bhanu Uday, Preeti Gupta, and Ankur Vikal. The performances are realistic and intense, capturing the emotions and conflicts of the characters. The movie also uses a non-linear narrative structure, switching between the past and the present, and between the two stories. This creates a sense of suspense and connection, as the viewers gradually discover the links and contrasts between the characters and their situations.
 
The movie does not shy away from depicting the brutality and injustice that the characters face, such as torture, rape, murder, and suicide. The movie also exposes the hypocrisy and corruption of the religious and political authorities, who use violence and propaganda to manipulate and oppress the people. The movie does not offer any easy solutions or happy endings, but rather leaves the viewers with a sense of despair and hopelessness. The movie is a powerful critique of the society that denies freedom and dignity to its people.
 
Unfreedom is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. It is a movie that will make you think, feel, and question. It is a movie that will challenge you to stand up for your rights and values. It is a movie that will remind you of the importance of love and humanity in a world full of hate and violence.
