Windows 8 For PSP is a custom firmware that allows users to run Windows 8 on their Sony PSP devices. It is based on the PSP V12 Build 107 18, which is a modified version of the official PSP firmware. Windows 8 For PSP aims to provide a similar user interface and functionality as the original Windows 8 operating system, such as the Start screen, live tiles, apps, settings, and more.

Windows 8 For PSP was created by a developer named Lisa Baker, who uploaded an audio file on SoundCloud explaining how to install and use the custom firmware[^1^]. According to Baker, Windows 8 For PSP is compatible with most PSP models, except for the PSP Go and the PSP E1000. Users need to have a memory stick with at least 4 GB of free space and a USB cable to connect their PSP to their computer. Users also need to download the Windows 8 For PSP files from a website called stayza.com[^2^], which provides a detailed guide on how to install the custom firmware.
 
Windows 8 For PSP is not an official product of Microsoft or Sony, and it may have some bugs or limitations. Users should be aware of the risks involved in installing custom firmware on their devices, such as voiding their warranty, bricking their device, or violating the terms of service.

However, Windows 8 For PSP also has some drawbacks and limitations. For instance, some apps may not work properly or at all on the PSP's hardware and screen resolution.
