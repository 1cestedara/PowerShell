## Method 1: Using SIMATIC Device Drivers
 
This method is recommended if you have installed SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.5 or other SIMATIC software products released for Windows 7. The required driver for the PC Adapter USB is part of SIMATIC Device Drivers, which are automatically installed with the SIMATIC software[^2^].
 
To install the SIMATIC PC Adapter USB driver using this method, follow these steps:

2. Connect the PC Adapter USB to a PLC via the MPI or PROFIBUS interface, or power it by an external supply.
3. Open Device Manager on your PC and look for an unknown device under Other devices.
4. Right-click on the unknown device and select Update Driver Software.
