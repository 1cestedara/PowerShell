Li Chen tells Paula that he has discovered the location of the Jade Idol, a legendary artifact that was once owned by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. The Jade Idol is said to grant its owner eternal life and power, but also to bring misfortune and death to those who misuse it.

The Dragon Society is led by a mysterious woman named Madame Fang, who has a personal vendetta against Paula and Li Chen. Madame Fang believes that she is the rightful heir of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang, and that the Jade Idol belongs to her.
