- Water spray systems are automatic and respond at all times. Fire control is therefore rapid and no human intervention is needed[^4^].
- Water spray systems can extinguish fires quickly and prevent fires from spreading over a large area. This minimizes the damage caused by fire and reduces downtimes, protecting the future of your business[^4^].
- Water spray systems have high flexibility in design and implementation. They can be used to protect various types of equipment and structures, such as storage tanks, process units, pipe racks, cable racks, building structures, etc[^5^].
- Water spray systems reduce fumes and bind contaminants. This reduces the environmental impact and health hazards of fire incidents[^4^].
- Water spray systems can also be used to mitigate flammable vapors and prevent the development of flammable vapor clouds. They work by entraining air into the spray cone and mixing the air and water droplets with the flammable vapor, thereby diluting the vapor[^6^].

We hope this article has helped you learn more about water spray systems for fire protection in the petroleum and petrochemical industries. If you want to learn more about this topic, you can refer to API RP 2030 or other related standards and publications.
